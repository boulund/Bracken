# Running Bracken
## Step 1: Classify all reads using Kraken and generate a Kraken report file
Kraken can be downloaded from here: http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/

Three steps are necessary to set up Kraken abundance estimation. 
It is assumed that `${KRAKEN_DB}` is the path to a built Kraken database, 
and all sequences are as `.fna` files in the `${KRAKEN_DB}/library` directory.

## Step 2: Produce a kmer distribution file for your Kraken database
### Step 2a: Search all library input sequences against the database

    kraken --db=${KRAKEN_DB} --fasta-input --threads=10 <( find -L library -name "*.fna" -o -name "*.fa" -o -name "*.fasta" -exec cat {} + )  > database.kraken

### Step 2b: Compute classifications for each perfect read from one of the input sequences
With `${READ_LENGTH} = 75`:

    perl count-kmer-abundances.pl --db=${KRAKEN_DB} --read-length=75 database.kraken  > database75mers.kraken_cnts

Set `${READ_LENGTH}` to whatever is the most likely perfect read length of your data. 
E.g., if you are using 100 bp reads, set it to `100`. 

## Step 3: Generate the kmer distribution file
The kmer distribution file is generated using the following command line:

    python generate_kmer_distribution.py -i database75mers.kraken_cnts -o KMER_DISTR.TXT

## Step 4: Estimate abundance
Given the expected kmer distribution for genomes in a kraken database along
with a kraken report file, the number of reads belonging to each species (or
genus) is estimated using the estimate_abundance.py file, run with the
following command line:

    python estimate_abundance.py -i <KRAKEN.REPORT> -k <KMER_DISTR.TXT> -l <CLASSIFICATON_LEVEL> -t <THRESHOLD> -o <OUTPUT_FILE.TXT>

The following required parameters must be specified:
- `<KRAKEN.REPORT>` - the kraken report generated for a given dataset 
- `<KMER_DISTR.TXT>` - the file generated by generate_kmer_distribution.py 
- `<OUTPUT_FILE.TXT>` - the desired name of the output file to be generated by the code

The following optional parameters may be specified:
- `<CLASSIFICATION_LEVEL>` - Default = `'S'`. This specifies that abundance
    estimation will calculate estimated reads for each species. Other possible
    options are K (kingdom level), P (phylum), C (class), O (order), F (family),
    and G (genus). 
- `<THRESHOLD>` - Default = `10`. For species classification, any species
    with <= 10 (or otherwise specified) reads will not receive any additional reads
    from higher taxonomy levels when distributing reads for abundance estimation.
    If another classification level is specified, thresholding will occur at
    that level.  

# Example abundance estimation
The following sample input and output files are included in the sample_data/ folder: 
    `sample_test.report` - Kraken report file generated from the kraken-report command. 
    `sample_kmer_distr_75mers.txt` - example kmer distribution file generated by generate_kmer_distribution.py
    `sample_output_species_abundance.txt` - Bracken species abundance estimation for sample_test.report 
    `sample_output_bracken.report` - Kraken report style file with all reads redistributed to the species level

Due to size constraints, the following files are not included in the sample_data/ folder:
    `sample_test.kraken` - Kraken output file used to generate the Kraken report file
    `database.kraken` - Initial Kraken classification of every genome
    `database75mers.kraken_cnts` - Counting of kmer abundances

The following commands were used to generate each individual file: 

1. ```
    kraken --db${KRAKEN_DB} --threads=10 sample.fa > sample_test.kraken
    kraken-report --db=${KRAKEN_DB} sample_test.kraken > sample_test.report 
   ```
2. ```
    kraken --db=${KRAKEN_DB} --fasta_input --threads=10 <( find -L library -name "*.fna" -o -name "*.fa" -o -name "*.fasta" -exec cat {} + ) > database.kraken 
    perl count-kmer-abubndances.pl --db=${KRAKEN_DB} --read-length=75 database.kraken > database75mers.kraken_cnts
   ```
3. ```
    python generate_kmer_distribution.py -i database75mers.kraken_cnts -o sample_kmer_distr_75mers.txt
   ```
4. ```
    python estimate_abundance.py -i sample_test.report -k sample_kmer_distr_75mers.txt -l S -t 10 -o sample_output_species_abundance.txt 
   ```
